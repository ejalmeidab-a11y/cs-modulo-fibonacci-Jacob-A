    "# Black Jack game explination\n",
    "# In Blackjack, the goal is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. To build our program, we will first create a full deck of 52 cards. We use a tuple for the card values (2–10, J=10, Q=10, K=10, A=11) because these values never change. Then we multiply those values by 4 suits to make a complete deck stored inside a list, since lists are mutable and we remove cards during gameplay. After creating the deck, we shuffle it and deal two cards each to the player and the dealer. The player and dealer hands will also be stored in lists, because we need to add cards with .append() when someone “hits.”\n",
    "# Next is the player’s turn. The program will always show the player’s hand and total. The player can choose hit (take a new card) or stand (stop). When calculating totals, we must solve the problem of Aces. An Ace starts as 11, but if the hand goes over 21, we must convert an Ace from 11 → 1 using a while loop until the total is safe. This Ace-adjustment logic is one of the biggest challenges of Blackjack. Another challenge is that multiple cards can have the same value (like four different 10-value cards). We solve this by using random.choice() and then removing that card from the deck list.\n",
    "# After the player finishes, the dealer plays automatically. The dealer must “hit” until reaching a total of 17 or higher, which we handle using a while loop. Finally, we compare the totals using if/elif logic, checking for busts, blackjacks, or ties (pushes). Another detail is that during the player’s turn, the dealer’s second card must stay hidden—we only show dealer_hand[0] until the end.\n",
